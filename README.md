# Supermarket Sales & Twitter Sentiment-Analysis
Supermarket Sales & Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dashboards Projects
## Project Description
I worked on cleaning and organizing two types of data: supermarket sales and Twitter tweets. I used Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, NLTK, and TextBlob to analyze the data and find patterns. In Power BI, I created calculations with DAX to get detailed insights about sales, customer behavior, and taxes. I also built a sentiment analysis to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral to understand peopleâ€™s opinions on different topics. I designed interactive dashboards that show important information like sales by city, top products, customer ratings, preferred payment methods, and how opinions change over time. This helped support better decision-making based on real data.
